The Weather Widget component not only fetches and displays the temperature and weather conditions but also provides additional details such as humidity and wind speed.

Here's an updated description that includes information about humidity and wind speed:

## Why the Weather Widget?

The Weather Widget is a crucial component for the planner app as it allows users to access real-time weather information based on their current location. With this widget, users can make informed decisions, plan activities, and schedule events based on the prevailing weather conditions.

- Location-Specific Weather:
  The widget provides accurate weather updates specific to the user's current location. By leveraging geolocation, it ensures that users receive relevant and up-to-date weather information, enhancing the usability and reliability of the planner app.

- Contextual Planning:
  By incorporating location-specific weather data, users can plan their activities, events, or tasks based on the current weather conditions. Factors such as temperature, precipitation, wind, humidity, and other weather elements enable users to make informed decisions and adjust their plans accordingly.

- Weather-Dependent Tasks:
  Certain tasks or events are weather-dependent, such as outdoor sports, gardening, or picnics. The location-specific widget empowers users to plan and schedule these activities based on the prevailing weather, optimizing their time and resources accordingly.

- Seamless User Experience:
  By integrating the Weather Widget, users can access weather information within the planner app itself, eliminating the need to switch to a separate weather app or manually input their location. The widget automatically retrieves the weather data based on their current location, providing a seamless and convenient user experience.

## How to Use the Widget?

The Weather Widget component can be seamlessly integrated into your planner app to provide users with essential weather information. Here's how users can interact with the widget:

- Upon opening the planner app, the Weather Widget will automatically fetch the weather data based on the user's current location (provided geolocation access is allowed).

- The widget will display the city name, current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions obtained from the OpenWeatherMap API.

- The weather information is updated in real-time, ensuring users have access to the latest data available.

- If any errors occur during the weather data retrieval process or if geolocation access is not supported or denied, appropriate error messages will be displayed to the user.

By incorporating the Weather Widget component in your planner app, users can easily access real-time weather information specific to their location. This empowers them to plan their activities effectively, make weather-informed decisions, and optimize their schedules based on the prevailing weather conditions.

## How Does the Code Functionality Work?

- The Weather Widget component is implemented as a functional component in React. It leverages geolocation and the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

- The component defines the apiKey variable, storing the API key from the environment variables to access the OpenWeatherMap API.

- useState hook is used to define state variables: weatherData and error, responsible for storing weather data and error messages, respectively.

- The useEffect hook is employed to perform an asynchronous operation for fetching weather data when the component mounts.

- The fetchWeatherData function is defined within the useEffect hook. It checks if the browser supports geolocation using the navigator.geolocation object.

- If geolocation is supported, the getCurrentPosition method retrieves the user's current latitude and longitude.

- Using these latitude and longitude values, the API request URL is constructed, including the apiKey and specifying the desired units (metric in this case).

- The fetch function sends the API request and receives the response. If the response is successful (status code 200), the data is converted to JSON format using the response.json() method.

- In case of a successful API request, the weather data is stored

in the weatherData state variable using the setWeatherData function.

- If there are any errors in the API response or during the data retrieval process, the error message is stored in the error state variable using the setError function.

- The component's return statement renders the weather widget's UI based on the state variables. If an error occurs, the error message is displayed. If the weather data is available, the city name, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions are shown. If the data is still loading, a loading message is displayed.

- The weather widget is wrapped in a div element with inline styles to set a minimum width.

In summary, the Weather Widget component utilizes geolocation to retrieve the user's current location. It then sends an API request to OpenWeatherMap using the latitude, longitude, and API key to fetch weather data. The retrieved data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions, is stored in state variables and rendered in the UI for the user to access.
